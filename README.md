Key Insights from Air Quality Index (AQI) Analysis (2018-2020) Based on Pollution Factors (PM2.5, CO, NO):

PM2.5 Trends:

Identified consistent spikes in PM2.5 levels during winter months, likely due to increased heating and burning activities.

Urban areas showed significantly higher PM2.5 concentrations compared to rural regions.


CO (Carbon Monoxide) Patterns:

CO levels peaked in industrial zones and areas with high vehicular density.

Seasonal trends indicated a rise in CO emissions during colder months, correlating with incomplete combustion.


NO (Nitric Oxide) Observations:

Elevated NO levels were linked to traffic congestion and industrial emissions, with peak levels during weekdays.

Significant reduction in NO levels observed during periods of reduced vehicular activity.


Overall Insights:

Correlation between AQI deterioration and high concentrations of PM2.5, CO, and NO.

Pollution hotspots and high-risk areas were identified for targeted interventions.

Seasonal and activity-based trends highlighted the need for stricter regulations during critical periods.

The analysis was performed using Power BI with interactive dashboards enabling detailed exploration of pollution factors by region, time, and category.
